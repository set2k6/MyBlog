  <h1>Some stuff about me</h1>
    <section>
      <p>Here's some stuff!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>im a gemini</li>
        <li>i drive fast</li>
        <li>i code</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's time to put on makeup. It's time to dress up right. It's time to raise the curtain on the Muppet Show tonight. Goodbye gray sky hello blue. There's nothing can hold me when I hold you. Feels so right it cant be wrong. Rockin' and rollin' all week long. In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Wouldn't you like to get away? Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. And they're always glad you came. Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum. What might be right for you may not be right for some.</p>

      <h1>My Khaled Philosophy</h1>
      <!-- paragraph -->
      <p> Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Cloth talk. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Eliptical talk. Eliptical talk. They never said le success, I can. I’m up to something. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough?</p>


      You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch. Bless up. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key.</p>
